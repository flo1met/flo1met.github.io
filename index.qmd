# Hi!

I am a PhD student in the Psychological Methods Group at the University of Amsterdam and a member of the [Bayesian Graphical Modeling Lab](https://bayesiangraphicalmodeling.com/). My research focuses on Bayesian methods for intensive longitudinal data, with particular interests in computation, network modeling, and causality.
I aim to make all my research and software openly available as open source.
